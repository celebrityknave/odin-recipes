    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A personal favourite for parties. Some batter and potatoes go a long way to feeding a crowd (even if it's not the most healthy option).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Plain Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Rice Flour</li>
        <li>1-2 L of frying oil (depending on size of pot)</li>
        <li>A pinch of table salt</li>
        <li>Chicken salt to season</li>
        <li>1/2 bottle of beer</li>
        <li>4-5 potatoes (depending on size)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the flours, a pinch of salt and half a bottle of beer in a large bowl. Whisk with a fork until smooth consistency. Target consistency should be a little thinner than pancake batter. Adjust liquid volumes to suit.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice potatoes and pat dry with some paper towel.</li>
        <li>Place oil in a large pot and heat to around 200 degrees celcius</li>
        <li>Once oil is at temperature, take each slice of potato and dip in batter, then place in pot. Cook in batches of 4-5 until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Once each batch is cooked, place on paper towl to drain oil and toss in chicken salt. Eat while fresh.</li>
    </ol>
